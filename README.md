# python-ipaddress

`python-ipaddress` is an implementation of the [PEP 3144 Draft](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3144/). The module is [available for download](http://ipaddr-py.googlecode.com/git/branches/3144/ipaddress.py) on the ipaddr-py project website. This is simply a conveniently-packaged copy for easy installation with `pip`.

This version of `ipaddress` is only compatible with Python 2 and provides a very similar API to that of the `ipaddress` module included in the Python Standard Library since Python 3.3.

## Installation

`pip install git+git://github.com/HaDiNet/python-ipaddress.git`
